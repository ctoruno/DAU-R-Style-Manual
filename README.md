# Desscription
This coding handbook is a continuous work maintained by the DAU from The World Justice Project (WJP) with the aim of unifying the different aspect of the carried by the unit. In this book, you will find not only general guidelines but also several issues that will help the reader to understand and contribute in our tasks.

The handbook cover aspects related to the general workflow, the coding process and the visualization guidelines used by the team. As mentioned earlier, this book is a continuous work in progress and, as such, the rules and guides are not written in stone but rather, subject to improvements that every member of the team is open to discuss and include in this handbook.

# Structure
The content in this Handbook is organized as follows:

1. **Part I**: Workflow: A brief chapter in which we will cover the basic guidelines and issues related to the DAU workflow when programming with R and R Studio along with the basic setup.

2. **Part II**: Coding: The main chapter of the handbook where we discuss the main aspects of the coding style when working in projects related to the DAU.

3. **Part III**: Viz Aesthetics: Manual of style, style guidelines, pre-defined settings and other aspects related exclusively to data visualization are presented in this chapter.

4. **Appendix**: Final part of the handbook where you can read about R-related content for the daily tasks that you will have to face as a member of the DAU.
