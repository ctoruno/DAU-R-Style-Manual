# Preface {.unnumbered}

This coding handbook is a continuous work mantained by the Data Analytics Unit (DAU) from The World Justice Project (WJP) with the aim of unifying the different aspect of the carried by the unit. In this book, you will find not only general guidelines but also several issues that will help the reader to understand and contribute in our tasks.

The handbook cover aspects related to the general workflow, the coding process and the visualization guidelines used by the team. As mentioned earlier, this book is a continuous work in progress and, as such, the rules and guides are not written in stone but rather, subject to improvements that every member of the team is open to discuss and include in this handbook.
